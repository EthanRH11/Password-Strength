# Password Strength Project

**Password Strength Project** is a C++ application designed to evaluate the strength of passwords, generate strong passwords, and store user passwords securely. The project is in progress, with the current functionality focused on evaluating password strength, generating passwords, and storing them. Future developments will expand the project into a full-fledged password manager.

## About

The Password Strength Project is aimed at improving password security by helping users create strong passwords and evaluate the strength of their current passwords. It provides an easy-to-use interface to generate random passwords, assess their strength based on common security criteria, and store them securely for later use. The project is still under development, with more features to be added in the future.

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: Analyzes passwords based on common criteria like length, complexity (use of numbers, symbols, uppercase letters), and dictionary word checks.
- **Password Generation**: Generates strong random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and character set.
- **Password Storage**: Currently allows for storing passwords securely, though this feature is still under development and will be expanded in future updates.

## Installation

This project is still under development and is not yet ready for installation or cloning. However, future installation steps will be outlined here once the project is stable and usable.

1. Clone the repository (future step).
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Configure the password storage functionality (will be detailed when it's ready).

## Usage

Currently, the project offers the following functionality:

- **Password Evaluation**: The user can input a password to receive an evaluation of its strength. The evaluation includes checks for length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and common patterns or dictionary words.
- **Password Generation**: The user can generate a random password with specific requirements, such as length and character types (numbers, symbols, etc.).
- **Password Storage**: User passwords can be stored, but this feature is in an early stage, and future versions will allow more robust management and retrieval of passwords.
